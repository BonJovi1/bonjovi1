I'm Abhinav, I'm a senior year undergraduate at the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad. I like to work at the intersection of  vision, machine learning and robotics. I am deeply passionate about computer vision, with a particular fondness for pose estimation, object detection and 3D scene understanding. 

Welcome to my GitHub, you can find all my projects here! 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a deep unsupervised image based visual servoing. \
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how one can use keypoints from pose estimates for activity and gait recognition. \
ðŸ‘¯ I'm very fascinated by the impact (both good and bad) that AI could have on humanity in the near future. \
ðŸ“« You can reach out to me anytime on my email. \
âš¡ When I'm not exploring the awesome world of deep learning, I spend my time drumming or playing the guitar. \
